# Color Picker

Description: This color picker is a follow-up project to my [color palette generator](https://github.com/bexcoding/color-palette-generator). With the palette generator, I could make various palettes of different types but there was no capability to pick specific colors or save them. This color picker will allow a user to pick or enter a color and choose different types of related colors to view (for example, triadic or tetradic colors). The live version of this project can be viewed and tested [here](https://bexcoding.github.io/color-picker/index.html) on my portfolio website.

# Functionality: 

- Color slider: Below the introductory text is a built in color slider. If you click on it, a color slider will appear that allows you to choose the desired color.
- Current color display: This is a square of color displayed beneath the color slider that allows the user to see a large sample of the selected color.
- Current color values: This area displays the numerical values for HEX, HSL, and RGB with regards to the current color.
- Related color area: This area includes a dropdown menu that allows the selection of one of six color relations: complimentary, triadic, tetradic, hues, saturation, and lightness. Each of these choices will show colors related to the originally selected color. For example, choosing "saturation" will show variations in saturation.
- Saved colors: The current color display or the related colors can each be clicked on to save them. On hover, they move slightly to show that they are being selected. When saved, the appear in a color lineup at the bottom of the page. The HEX value is displayed on hover over the saved color. This section can be used to save a custom user palette.
