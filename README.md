# Color Picker

This color picker is a follow-up project to my color palette generator. With the palette generator, I could make various palettes of different types but there was no capability to pick specific colors or save them. This color picker will allow a user to pick or enter a color and choose different types of related colors to view (for example, triadic or tetradic colors).
